		<br><b>Summary</b><br>

		My Speed Test collects periodic measurements of your cellular phone's network and the performance of your
		cellular service based on traffic and requests generated by the Ping
		software (active measurements). The My Speed Test team collects information about your
		network service, current applications and device details such as battery status. All personal information such as 
		phone number and device Id will be encrypted and unavailable even to the My Speed Test team.
		Information about your network service,
		applications, cellular device details and latency performance measurements will be used to present a
		report of your network performance, and to conduct research related to
		home network and broadband Internet performance. Your information will
		be retained for the duration of your participation in the study. <br>

		<br><b>Full Statement</b><br>


		This statement describes the information collected as part of your
		participation in My Speed Test, as well as how this information is used, disclosed,
		and retained. This statement does not attempt to characterize the risks of
		collecting or storing the information, or the disclosure of this information as
		described below. You must assess and accept the risks of participating in
		My Speed Test before you agree to participate in the study.<br>

		<br>Information we collect, and how we use it<br>

		<br>We collect three types of information, for the following purposes:
		<ul>
		<li><i>Device identity information</i> is collected to maintain unique identity of each user. The 
		  information is however encrypted using a hashcode. Therefore, the actual details of the users
		  are not available to anyone except the user. </li>
		<li><i>Device performance information</i> These device parameters are used in research, analysis and 
		  evaluation to determine the effect of non network parameters on network performance. </li>
		<li><i>Service Information</i> is also collected as part of the measurments. This
		  information will be used for research, analysis, and evaluation of cellular network service performance.</li>
		<li><i>Active Measurement Information</i> is collected by the My Speed Test application.
		  This information will be used for research, analysis, and evaluation of cellular
		  data network performance. </li>
		<li><i>Application Information</i> is collected by the My Speed Test application for research, analysis and 
		  evaluation of the network usage of various applications and user application usage behavior.  </li>
		</ul>

		Specific examples of information collected in each of these categories is given
		below:<br>

		<br><i>Device identity Information</i>
		<ul>
		<li>device id</li>
		<li>telephone number</li>
		<li>SIM serial</li>
		</ul>
		
		<i>Device performance Information</i>
		<ul>
		<li>Battery charge</li>
		<li>Battery health</li>
		<li>Device manufacturer</li>
		<li>Device Model</li>
		<li>Signal Strength</li>
		</ul>

		<i>Service Information</i>
		<ul>
		<li>Network Operator</li>
		<li>Tower CellID</li>
		<li>Network Type</li>
		</ul>
		<i>Active Measurement Information**</i>
		<ul>
		<li>throughput (speed) from the cellular device to measurement servers</li>
		<li>latency (ping time) from the cellular device to 3 different Internet locations</li>
		<li>cellular device WAN interface IP address</li>
		</ul>

		<b>Personally-identifiable information</b><br>

		We consider the following information to be personally-identifiable information
		(PII). This information will be HASHED and ENCRYPTED at all times. It will be
		inaccesible by everyone.
		<ul>
		<li>telephone number</li>
		<li>device id</li>
		<li>device serial number</li>
		<li>SIM number</li>
		<li>gateway WAN interface IP address</li>
		<li>gateway MAC addresses</li>
		</ul>
		
		<b>Information disclosure</b><br>

		All of the information described above will be collected, maintained, and used
		by the My Speed Test team. We may disclose this information outside of the My Speed Test
		team in the following ways:
		<ul>
		<li>Active Measurement Information, Device performance Information and Service Information, with the exception of
		 aforementioned PII, will be accessible to members of the My Speed Test team as well as authorized 
		  members at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</li>
		<li>The My Speed Test team will utilize the Active Measurement Information, Device Performance Information and Service
		  Information to produce scholarly works such as articles, reports, and
		  presentations that will be published and publicly accessible. These results
		  will typically contain aggregated and derivative information, but may contain
		  raw Active Measurement Information, Device Performance Information or Service Information, excluding PII.</li>
		<li>Any information collected as part of My Speed Test, including PII, may potentially
		  be disclosed in response to a lawful request by law enforcement or other
		  legal processes or authorities.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<b>Information retention</b><br>

		Device identity information will be retained for the duration of the Ping 
		study. Service Information, Device Performance Information
		and Active Measurement Information (excluding PII) will be retained for at least
		the duration of the Ping study.<br>

		<br><b>Information security</b></br>

		We take measures to protect the information collected as described above. We
		encrypt information as it is transmitted between your device and our
		servers. We have implemented access controls to limit access to information 
		stored on our servers.
