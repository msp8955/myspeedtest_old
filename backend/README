INITIALIZATION
--------------
1. In settings.py, change the location of:
- MEDIA_ROOT
- TEMPLATE_DIRS

So that <dashboard-root> points to the location of your installation. (Default 'dashboard-root' is '/home/feamster/')

2. Try the development server:
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

This should work without a hitch on dp4.gtnoise.net.  If you are running with a local copy, you may need to also create a local mirror of the database.

It would be good to recreate this repo without passwords in it.

AND SWITCH TO SVN
