Ping Privacy Statement
=========================

Summary
-------

Ping collects periodic measurements of your cellular phone's network and the performance of your
cellular service based on traffic and requests generated by the Ping
software (active measurements). ** The Ping team collects information about your
network service, current applications and device details such as battery status. **All personal information such as 
phone number and device Id will be encrypted and unavailable even to the Ping team.
Information about your network service,
applications, cellular device details and Ping performance measurements will be used to present a
report of your network performance, and to conduct research related to
home network and broadband Internet performance. Your information will
be retained for the duration of your participation in the study.

Full Statement
--------------

This statement describes the information collected as part of your
participation in Ping, as well as how this information is used, disclosed,
and retained. This statement does not attempt to characterize the risks of
collecting or storing the information, or the disclosure of this information as
described below. You must assess and accept the risks of participating in
Ping before you agree to participate in the Ping study.

### Information we collect, and how we use it

We collect three types of information, for the following purposes:

- **Device identity information** is collected to maintain unique identity of each user. The 
  information is however encrypted using a hashcode. Therefore, the actual details of the users
  are not available to anyone except the user. 
- **Device performance information** These device parameters are used in research, analysis and 
  evaluation to determine the effect of non network parameters on network performance. 
- **Service Information** is also collected as part of the measurments. This
  information will be used for research, analysis, and evaluation of cellular network service performance.
- **Active Measurement Information** is collected by the Ping application.
  This information will be used for research, analysis, and evaluation of cellular
  data network performance. 
- **Application Information** is collected by the Ping application for research, analysis and 
  evaluation of the network usage of various applications and user application usage behavior.  


Specific examples of information collected in each of these categories is given
below:

**Device identity Information**

- device id
- telephone number
- SIM serial

**Device performance Information**

- Battery charge
- Battery health
- Device manufacturer
- Device Model
- Signal Strength

**Service Information**
- Network Operator
- Tower CellID
- Network Type

**Active Measurement Information**

- throughput (speed) from the cellular device to measurement servers
- latency (ping time) from the cellular device to 3 different Internet locations
- cellular device WAN interface IP address


### Personally-identifiable information

We consider the following information to be personally-identifiable information
(PII). This information will be HASHED and ENCRYPTED at all times. It will be
inaccesible my anyone.

- telephone number
- device id
- device serial number
- SIM number
- gateway WAN interface IP address
- gateway MAC addresses

Information disclosure
----------------------

All of the information described above will be collected, maintained, and used
by the Ping team. We may disclose this information outside of the Ping
team in the following ways:

- Active Measurement Information, Device performance Information and Service Information, with the exception of
 aforementioned PII, will be accessible to members of the Ping team as well as authorized 
  members at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
- The Ping team will utilize the Active Measurement Information, Device Performance Information and Service
  Information to produce scholarly works such as articles, reports, and
  presentations that will be published and publicly accessible. These results
  will typically contain aggregated and derivative information, but may contain
  raw Active Measurement Information, Device Performance Information or Service Information, excluding PII.
- Any information collected as part of Ping, including PII, may potentially
  be disclosed in response to a lawful request by law enforcement or other
  legal processes or authorities.

Information retention
---------------------

Device identity information will be retained for the duration of the Ping 
study. Service Information, Device Performance Information
and Active Measurement Information (excluding PII) will be retained for at least
the duration of the Ping study.

Information security
--------------------

We take measures to protect the information collected as described above. We
encrypt information as it is transmitted between your device and our
servers. We have implemented access controls to limit access to information 
stored on our servers.
